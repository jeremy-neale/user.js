# Firefox configuration
Firefox is an open-source browser that allows easy custom configuration with a `user.js`.

# Installation/usage

-> Download the `user.js` script in this (or a different) repository.

-> In Firefox, visit `about:support` and press `Open Directory` in the `Profile Directory` section.

-> Add the `user.js` file to this directory.

-> Restart Firefox.

# Objectives

This user.js script is designed to be simple and compatible.

1. All `telemetry` is disabled, including default telemetry, crash reports, and studies.

-> Telemetry is data collection/tracking that sends data to Mozilla servers.

2. `Pocket` disabled.

-> Pocket is the default browser extension to store articles between devices, but it contains sponsored messages.

3. Increased default refresh rate and smoother scrolling to enhance user experience.

Unlike some other Firefox "hardening" javascript files, this does not impact cookies or fingerprinting or other services that make some websites incompatible.
